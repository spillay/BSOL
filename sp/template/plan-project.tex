\section{High Level Project Plan}
\subsection{Work Breakdown Structure}
On acceptance of the Government order by \vendor, the \vendor project manager shall have a work session with the \client project owner to draw a detailed project charter and plan for the project to be executed by \vendor.  
\\ \\
A high level project schedule is attached for project proposal evaluation purposes. Note that a fixed list of tasks and deliverables is applicable up until the recommended solution for the requirement; thereafter it is only an estimate as this rest of the project is dependent on the specific solution option that \client accepted. For example the type of government department and the level of e-services.  The table below depicts all project phases to ensure the successful execution of the project:
