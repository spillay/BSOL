\subsection{Research Cost Break Down}
Since the research phase would be conducted in parallel to the implementation and it would span three years, a break down is provided below.

\subsection{Payment Schedule}
The payment process for services delivered by \vendor shall commence with the approval of each document by the \client.  Under no circumstances shall \client withhold payments to \vendor. 
\subsection{Subsistence and Travel Costs}
These costs shall be paid for separately by the client - depending on the number of visits the client requests to be undertaken to successfully execute the project.  The standard rate for kilometres travelled is R3.16 /km travelled and the per diem allowance per day is R241.60 / day. The client shall also be responsible for actual costs incurred for accommodation, car rental and air travel where applicable. On commencement of the project an initial down-payment would be required; as per the complying rules for \vendor and \client.

\subsection{Time Estimate}
The time estimate is depicted by the table/schedule below. The execution time per activity is given; note that certain activities shall be performed simultaneously with others.  The actual dates for starting with the project and subsequently with the listed activities below shall be determined by the date which the project shall officially commence.
